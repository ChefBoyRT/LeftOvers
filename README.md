## General info
Leftovers is a simple web application that helps users monitor and track food waste. Enter the ingredient name,
expiration date, quantity, and price. Leftovers will display the information on an easy to read card that calculates the 
amount of time in days until the expiration date. The card dynamically updates from green, yellow, to red as the ingredient 
approaches its expiration date to provide visual cues for users. If food will not be used before expiration, convert the food to food waste by filling out the form. Then, navigate to the waste dashboard to view your waste habits over time. To prevent food from turning to waste, check out the find recipes tab to convert your current digital fridge into declicious recipes.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for Leftovers comes from a personal goal to reduce my food waste footprint. I believe the first step to
reducing waste is to understand one's contribution to the problem. Providing users with data and a simple to use tracker
will help create awareness and empower users with a personal call to action.
